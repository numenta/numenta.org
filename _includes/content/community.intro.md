  Working together towards a new era of Machine Intelligence.

The [NuPIC source code]({{ site.data.url.ext.repo }}) is used by Numenta as a
part of a commercial product development. Because of this, it is no longer a
“pure” implementation of the HTM algorithms. We have made optimizations, added
tweaks, and taken some short cuts to improve performance. For those interested
in studying and characterizing a purer form of the HTM, please be aware of these
changes. If your interest is using NuPIC in a product, then you may be happy
with the code as-is or you may want to make additional changes.

Everyone is welcome to pitch in and contribute!
