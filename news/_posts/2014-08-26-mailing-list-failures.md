Our mailing lists are currently operating in a limited capacity due to a new
[DMARC policy implemented by Yahoo!](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2141120/yahoo-email-antispoofing-policy-breaks-mailing-lists.html). 
We are working to fix this ASAP.

[Check mailing list status here](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Mailing-List-Status).
